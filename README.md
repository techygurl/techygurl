# Hi there, I'm Nissi!
Hey everyone, Nissi here,

I am a Data Analyst who transitioned into the field from a non-technical background

The Data field has completely changed my life, so I've made it part of my mission to also guide others (especially women) into the field who are also from a non-technical background

My specialties are Data Visualization, BI Development, and Data Translation. I utilize Power BI, Tableau, Python & SQL

If you are looking for a Data Analyst to join your team or on a contract basis, I'd love to chat

OR if you are an aspiring Data Analyst looking for guidance, I would love to chat as well 

shoot me a DM !!

##  What I Do

I work closely with teams to:
- Define goals  
- Uncover whatâ€™s holding them back  
- Align the right people, strategies, and processes to move forward  

I break down real business problems and map out practical solutions that actually get implemented.

Whether itâ€™s turning a rough idea into a fully launched solution or keeping stakeholders aligned, I bring structure to uncertainty and help teams stay focused on what truly matters.
